          <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">SDCC 2023: Concept Art for Marvel Studios' 'The Marvels' Revealed</h2><br>
          <article>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              You never know what might happen at the Marvel booth at San Diego Comic-Con! 
<br><br>
Marvel Studios' Director of Visual Development Andy Park arrived onto the Marvel SDCC stage where he revealed never before seen concept art of Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel/Kamala Khan, and Monica Rambeau from Marvel Studios' <i><a> The Marvels </a></i>&nbsp; and talked about his legacy of design work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  You can see the full interview in the video above and you can see his stunning concept art poster below.
<br><br>
When asked about his approach to designing a new costume for Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel for <a>The Marvels</a>, Andy Park commented,<i> "Her look is a little more relaxed. She's rolled up her sleeves and it's not as soldier-y/armor-y as it was before [in previous films]."</i> 
<br><br>
In addition to Carol, Monica and Kamala are now part of this team-up and Andy shared about their design inspiration, "As we always do, we look at the comics, we look at their origins, the amazing comic book creators who have created these designs - those are always our inspiration for how to design these. We're looking at the source material, the comic books...and then trying to fit it into the story we're trying to tell."

            <article>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Ready for one last ride? Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is now streaming on Disney+. 
                <br><br>
                In <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i> our beloved band of misfits are settling into life on Knowhere. But it isn’t long before their lives are upended by the echoes of Rocket’s turbulent past. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him on a dangerous mission to save Rocket’s life—a mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.
                 <br><br>
                The film stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, featuring Vin Diesel as Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter and Maria Bakalova.
